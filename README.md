This simple script reads order data from an Excel spreadsheet using 'openpyxl' and then uses the data to create printable order forms using 'python-docx'.

Some background:
This script was made to reduce the time spent creating order forms by taking in order data from a pre-made Excel spreadsheet and filling in the areas of the order form template. Order forms were saved as individual Word documents to be printed and reviewed if needed. This project was done for an event at my temple.
